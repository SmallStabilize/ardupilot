依托 Ardupilot 官方代码，然后进行学习，以及开发尝试，受限水平，会有一些错误
A 星算法的基础架构来自于Alan Lan,然而其中有几处关键错误（我认为），导致其结果错了，对其基础架构进行修改
改进A星算法为本人最先提出的，能够应用于自组网的双步长策略，2022.5.20开源，相关人员引用应注明出处

Relying on the official Ardupilot code, and then learning, and trying to develop, limited level, there will be some mistakes
The a-Star algorithm's infrastructure came from Alan Lan, however there were A few key errors (I think) that led to the wrong result and the infrastructure was changed
The improved A-star algorithm is A two-step strategy that I first proposed and can be applied to AD hoc networking. It is open source in 2022.5.20 and relevant people should indicate the source
