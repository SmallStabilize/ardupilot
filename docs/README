依托 Ardupilot 官方代码，然后进行学习，以及开发尝试，受限水平，会有一些错误 
A 星算法的基础架构来自于Alan Lan的开源代码,然而其中有几处关键错误（我认为），导致其结果错了，对其基础架构进行修改 

基于双步长、可跳过点的两种改进A星算法为本人最先提出的，能够应用于自组网的双策略，2022.5.20开源，相关人员引用应注明出处

Relying on the official Ardupilot code, and then learning, and trying to develop, limited level, there will be some mistakes
The infrastructure of the A-Star algorithm came from Alan Lan's open source code, however there were several critical errors (I think)
that resulted in the wrong result 
and the infrastructure was modified

The two improved A-star algorithms based on double-step size and skipped point are the dual-strategy that 
I first proposed and can be applied to AD hoc network, 2022.5.20 open source, relevant people should indicate the source
